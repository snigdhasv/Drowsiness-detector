# Drowsiness-detector
a real-time drowsiness detection system that uses a webcam to monitor eye closure. It calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to identify potential drowsiness. If the EAR falls below a certain threshold for a specified number of frames, the system triggers an alert by playing a beep sound and displaying an alert message on the screen.
